# Udacity Project - Would You Rather

## Details

This project was created for the Udacity React Nanodegree Program.  It is my solution
to the "Would you rather..." project.

This project allows you to answer "Would you rather..." questions proposed by other users.  It also
provides you the ability to create your "Would you rather..." questions for others to answer.

A leaderboard is used to show who is answering the most questions.

## Installation

To install this project, you must run the following commands:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/erj1/udacity-would-you-rather.git
$ cd udacity-would-you-rather
$ yarn install
$ yarn start
```

## Contributing

Because this project evaluates my ability to utilize React and Redux, I will not be accepting merge
requests at this time.  However, please feel free to provide any helpful suggestions as I continue
to learn these technologies.
